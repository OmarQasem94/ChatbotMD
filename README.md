## **Summary**

The chatbot created in this project was operational and successfull at having fairly seamless conversations with the user. It successfully provides a diagnosis based on the symptoms provided by the user, suggests medications and preventative measures when asked to, and suggests resources that would connect the user with a professional that can provide a consultation. 

To improve the accuracy of this chatbot further data that entails various diseases, medications, and surgeries would facilitate a much more acurate diagnosis. Furthermore, the incorporation of personal halth records would enable the chatbot to provide individua; specific advice.
